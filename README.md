# Fires_avocadoland Database
The files in this repository includes a Data Base in CSV format with fire records from two mexican forestry institutions (COFOM & CONAFOR). The geographic coordinates of the records were corrected and verificied on field. The file "Fire records on avocadoland.csv" and the file "Fire records on avocadoland with recurrences.csv" were refered by Olivares-Martinez, Gomez-Tagle and Perez-Salicrup (2023). The difference between the two CSV files is that the latter includes a column about the recurrence as intersections of an specific fire circular area with the rest of the fires.

   abstract = {The state of Michoacán in central Mexico supplies nearly 50% of the global avocado trade in a region known as the Michoacan Avocado Belt or Avocadoland. Fire has been a component associated with regional land-use change processes. We documented fire regime attributes for the period 2000–2017, discussed the use of fire related to the expansion of avocado orchards, and evaluated the role of atmospheric variables and human infrastructure. There was a mean of 276 fires covering 3287 ha of forest per year. Over 80% of the burned area was covered by pine and pine–oak forests, with a strong correlation of ignitions with the distance to urban settlements, roads, agricultural plots, and avocado orchards. There is a median fire return interval of 2–3 years, and the distance to avocado orchards and main roads was highly correlated with fire recurrence. Final users of the international marketing of this fruit may be unaware of the fire-related land-use changes, namely, the damage to biodiversity, forest health, and water bodies, as well as to producers’ well-being, behind the great demand for avocados. The present conditions of insecurity and social conflict must be addressed to guarantee, among other things, the conservation of these diverse forests.},
