# Fires_avocadoland Database
The files in this repository includes a Data Base in CSV format with fire records from two mexican forestry institutions (COFOM & CONAFOR). The geographic coordinates of the records were corrected and verificied on field. The file "Fire records on avocadoland.csv" and the file "Fire records on avocadoland with recurrences.csv" were refered by Olivares-Martinez, Gomez-Tagle and Perez-Salicrup (2023). The difference between the two CSV files is that the latter includes a column about the recurrence as intersections of an specific fire circular area with the rest of the fires.
